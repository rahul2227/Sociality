# sociality

## Problem at hand 
---
Continuous unproductive distraction due to many social platforms, users are unable to complete the work before the deadline, and also grow intellectually, resulting in professional and academic instability.

## Cause for this situation:
---

**Switching of the technical environment:**
"We are distracted as soon as we leave the academic environment, which doesn't happen if we are digitally reading something related to the task at hand"

**Instant Gratification:**
The brain feels immediately accomplished when we reply to a message and look at memes creating a false feeling of happiness or being wanted by someone.

**Lack of resources at a place:**
"There are many resources on the internet but are in a form of unstructured data"

## Solution:
---
Create a productive environment to work by providing resources at a single place and further create a place where you can have the rest you deserve, in which you can do anything you would like be it binging a TV show.
